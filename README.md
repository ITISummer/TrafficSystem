And the entrance class where you can start the project is Main.java.
So, if you clone the project to your local machine, you can start from Main.java.

5. The last attention is after you start the project in Main.java, you should do the first thing is click the "start" button in top-left corner. it does not show the button because of the repaint of the main panel has covered the button, you should hover your mouse pointer on the top-left area of the pop-up panel.
